# Real Estate Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict real estate prices based on various features. The model leverages historical data to forecast property prices, utilizing Python and various data science libraries.

## Technologies Used

- *Python*: Programming language used for developing the model.
- *Pandas*: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- *NumPy*: Library for numerical operations.
- *Matplotlib*: Plotting library for data visualization.
- *Seaborn*: Statistical data visualization library.
- *Scikit-learn*: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- *Jupyter Notebook*: Interactive computing environment for code development and documentation.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Model training and evaluation using Scikit-learn.
- Performance metrics to assess the model's accuracy.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the necessary Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```
